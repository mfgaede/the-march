2:28,,"""The footstep of the March on Washington was firm, with a quiet purpose and a mannerly rhythm. It aroused, even in dissenters, a larger awareness of the right of the Negros, as Americans, to share equally — not only the sun and air, so clear and free on the day of their march, but their right as Americans to share opportunity and privilege as well. America has known this, intellectually, for a long time — for 100 years, by history's calendar. On August 28th, America learned this emotionally, with clarity more penetrating than intellect, every kind and class. Every generation of America participated — if not in the city of Washington, across the land by television, America mutely attended the feeling of the March, and heard the all-encompassing cry for freedom from indignity. America heard back, into the miles of her history, to Lincoln, Jefferson, Tom Paine, Patrick Henry; everybody attended the March in Washington of August 28th.""",Narration,

4:52,,"""Momentum for the march began slowly. By 11:30 AM, a mounting tide of children, students, parents, grandparents — placards and banners held aloft — were walking down the wide avenue named in honor of the Constitution of the country. No attempt was made or thought given to strict lines of marching. The mood of the day was serious, but relaxed; 200,000 strong they marched, in the largest demonstration for civil rights in the history of the United States.""",Narration,

5:49,,"""Catholics, Protestants, and Jews; the humble and the famous; Westerners, Northerners, and Southerners; a cross section of the 50 states were represented as they progressed along the avenue, loosely grouped together by states or organizations or busloads. Some arrived by roller skates; some by train and plane. Some drove private automobiles thirty, fifty miles. All now walk to the memorial site preserved in honor of Abraham Lincoln. They walk to express to the nation, in a peaceful fashion, their rights — to freely assemble and be heard, as spelled out in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The First Amendment requires that the government not only refrain from interference with peaceful assemblies; it must restrain the restrainers as well. The Boston Tea Party led off a long chain of effective social protests in America. The suffragette demonstrations spread to many cities before their cause was victorious, and the struggles of American labor were traditionally advertised through the right to peacefully assemble and be heard. A renowned American jurist recently said, 'a function of free speech under our system...is to invite dispute. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.'""",Narration,

10:51,,"Burt Lancaster: ""All Americans traveling no matter where in the world today are in the position of ambassadors, and are very often made bitterly aware of our country's reputation. It is not easy to be an American abroad. Nor is it easy to make coherent to those who are not Americans the nature and the meaning of our struggle, and we are therefore forever indebted to those Americans represented by the March on Washington Movement for giving us so stunningly an example of what America aspires to become and for helping us to redefine in the middle of this dangerous century what is meant by the American Revolution. We recognize that it is not only in America that the battle for freedom and dignity of peoples is being waived. The struggle toward freedom on the part of the previously-subjugated is occurring in capitals and villages all over the world. It is on our awareness of what this struggle means, and in the degree of our dedication to it, that our future, and the future of the world, depends.""",Speeches,

19:10,," ""The slumbering conscience of America stood aroused, tall and awakened, as twilight fell over the March in Washington of August 28th. It admitted a lingering sense of shame; it admitted pain had been overlooked. In so doing, America reminded herself of her destiny; her aspirations; the dream which brought forth her birth. And America turned her eyes full upon the issues of freedom and justice — issues for all. She turned her attention to the Civil Rights Bill before the Congress, which is currently under examination of the elected representatives of all the towns and cities of the land. She turned her thoughts to the job ahead. The sound and spirit of the massive reminder of the meaning of freedom traveled around the world on the day of August 28th, rightfully initiating from the grounds where Abraham Lincoln sits silently and gravely, watching over this land from memorial erected to his memory. The U.S. is reminded it is not enough to hope together, to pray together; she is reminded she must speak and act for the common good.""",Speeches,
