We recognize that it is not only in America that the battle for freedom and dignity of peoples is being waived. The struggle toward freedom on the part of the previously-subjugated is occurring in capitals and villages all over the world. It is on our awareness of what this struggle means, and in the degree of our dedication to it, that our future, and the future of the world, depends.\"",

And America turned her eyes full upon the issues of freedom and justice — issues for all. She turned her attention to the Civil Rights Bill before the Congress, which is currently under examination of the elected representatives of all the towns and cities of the land. She turned her thoughts to the job ahead. The sound and spirit of the massive reminder of the meaning of freedom traveled around the world on the day of August 28th, rightfully initiating from the grounds where Abraham Lincoln sits silently and gravely, watching over this land from memorial erected to his memory. The U.S. is reminded it is not enough to hope together, to pray together; she is reminded she must speak and act for the common good.\"",
