America has known this, intellectually, for a long time — for 100 years, by history's calendar. On August 28th, America learned this emotionally, with clarity more penetrating than intellect, every kind and class. Every generation of America participated — if not in the city of Washington, across the land by television, America mutely attended the feeling of the March, and heard the all-encompassing cry for freedom from indignity. America heard back, into the miles of her history, to Lincoln, Jefferson, Tom Paine, Patrick Henry; everybody attended the March in Washington of August 28th.\"",

They walk to express to the nation, in a peaceful fashion, their rights — to freely assemble and be heard, as spelled out in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The First Amendment requires that the government not only refrain from interference with peaceful assemblies; it must restrain the restrainers as well. The Boston Tea Party led off a long chain of effective social protests in America. The suffragette demonstrations spread to many cities before their cause was victorious, and the struggles of American labor were traditionally advertised through the right to peacefully assemble and be heard. A renowned American jurist recently said, 'a function of free speech under our system...is to invite dispute. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.'\"",
